b1
	Continuing attempt to get GEMC working
	Playing around with b1 rates, trying to match those in proposal
	ptrates.f isn't compiling -- reloading from tar file to see if I can fix it
	Recording labels from all of the output files of ptrates.f and incorporating them into LibreOffice Calc to understand how the outputs work
	Continuing to play with b1 rates and add comments to the FORTRAN code as I figure out how it works
	Added rates and time bar graphs to rates/scripts/new_proj_b1.sh
	Worked on rates plots
	Comparing existing ND3 rates to LiD rates -- this needs to be updated
	Edited b1 wiki for meeting
	b1 meeting
	Worked on 'setting the board' for playing with rates -- added kinematics plots to projection plot analysis
	Finished "Setting the Board" for the b1 rates game
	Began playing with the rates to get a sense of where we want to be
	Seeing how rates change when adjusting Q^2
	Created animated *.gif files to show how the rates change with a scan over Q^2
	Found best-case physics rates for x=0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.625 (assuming that ptrates.f is working correctly)
	Created b1 wiki site for rates update
	Implemented PAC time into b1 rates code
	Began figuring out how to implement total rates into b1 rates code
	Began implementing total rates into b1 rates code
	Working on adding QE peak to b1 rates code
	Got the b1 rates code to accept x values up to x=0.9
	Got quasi-elastic peak kind of working in b1 code (can get up to x=0.98)
	Added dx error bars in b1 rates code
	Trying to double-check that the cross section part of the code is working correctly -- I think there's a problem
	Made sure the cross section calculations in the b1 rates code works correctly
	Making a copy of the rates script in a spreadsheet so that I understand absolute everything that it's doing
	Made website for b1 meeting
	b1 Meeting
	Completely understand what the b1 rates code is doing (Finally!! :-D )
	Matched up back-of-envelope calculation of rates to the b1 rates code -- they are within the same order of magnitude! :-D (Off by about 0.6, but that could be due to kinematic clipping that the b1 rates code does that the quick estimate doesn't take into account)
	Playing with b1 rates spreadsheet
	Updated labbook with the work I've been doing
	Began implementing He and N cross sections into spreadsheet
	Working on figuring out how dAzz is calculated from the rates
	Added He-4 and N-14 rates to spreadsheet
	Added Mott and unpolarized cross sections for He-3 and N-14 into the b1 rates FORTRAN script -- haven't included in the total yet
	Changed the b1 rates FORTRAN script so that it uses absolute error bars instead of relative ones
	Added He-4 and N-14 rates into the b1 rates code
	Finalized x=0.1 to x=1.0 rates at total rate=1kHz and 50kHz
	Included total rates in the output of the b1 rates code
	Fixed the time calculation (it was in days, I switched it to hours)
	Began playing the rates game in two parts: 1) with total rate < 1kHz, 2) with total rate < 50kHz
	Ran rates code for 50kHz and 500 kHz total rates
	b1 Meeting
	Added spectrometer theta and E' limits to b1 rates code
	Began working on switching the meaning of prec in b1 rates code -- currently, it's dAzz, but I want to make it time so that the code will be easier to run
	Mapped out F1 for each of the x points we're looking at
	Minimized db1 in rates plot
	Wrote script to scan F1 over a large x range, within kinematics we can take
	Worked on rates for b1 -- found a problem with the cross sections and dilution factors
	b1 meeting
	Working on the b1 cross sections so that they give a ratio of ~0.3 instead of ~0.0085
	Finalized rates calculations, things look good!
	Writing up what I did for the b1 meeting tomorrow

Quasi-Elastic 3He
	Running Ay0 data without HAND -- trying to see if (e,e') matches Yawei's results
	Quasi-Elastic meeting
	Re-running Ay (e,e') for vertically polarized 3He at Q2=0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 to compare with Yawei's analysis of the same runs
	Plotted run-by-run 3He(e,e') Ay asymetries to compare to Yawei
	Quasi-Elastic Meeting
	Matching 3He(e,e') run set so that Yawei and I are using the same runs to compare our data
	Compared Nup, Ndown, ChargeUp, ChargeDown, LTup, and LTdown of my analysis and Yawei's
	Continued comparison between Yawei's and my Ay0 data to try and find errors (LT is off the most)
	Put together website for Quasi-Elastic meeting
	Quasi-Elastic Meeting
	Quasi-Elastic Meeting
