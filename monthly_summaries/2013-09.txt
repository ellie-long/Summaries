	UNH Collaboration Meeting
	Continued attempting to get GPIB working (Installed updated drivers for PCI board)
	Picked up lift from John Wilderman 
	Set up lift and took magnet off the jack
	Installed LabView and associated software on UNH ultrabook in an attempt to get the GPIB-ENET device working
	Got GPIB ENET working with the PC

	Organized new equipment in the lab
	Raised lift stand to its maximum height to prepare for first lift tomorrow
	Ran roots pump for 30 minute maintenaince run
	Prepped lab for tomorrow's lift
	Completed first magnet lift
	Got measurements on the bottom plate for future thermometry stand
	Measured the inner diameter in the top and bottom of the cryostat
	Figured out how to move the cryostat
	Found out we'll need to solder more wires to include the thermometry
	Lifted magnet internals out to show to Karl and to continue planning placement of thermometry 
	Routine mainetaince run on the roots pump
	Confirmed that magnet only has a few wires attached to the backside of the 19-pin cable (We'll need to add extra for the thermometry)
	Roots pump maintenaince run
	Recorded the weekend's temp/humidity data
	Prepped the lab to move the milling machine out this morning
	Moved the milling machine into the machine shop
	Measured noise level (dB) of the pumps at various locations inside and outside of the lab


b1
	Local b1 meeting
	Worked on b1 rates code to continue allowing for quasi-elastic and SRC-range physics
	Added more x bins (up to 11) to b1 rates code
	Edited b1 rates code to properly plot the kinematics when only a single spectrometer is being looked at


Azz
	Checked current b1 code to see where it is in regards to calculating the QE region (F1 and F2 are ready, just need a model that extends Azz to higher x)
	Played with b1 rates code to stake a claim on the x>1 measurement
	Worked on incorporating the 1988 Frankfurt and Strikman Azz plot into the b1 rates code for x>1
	Estimated the 1988 F&S Azz plot using a spreadsheet and image overlay, as unfortunately a direct calculation is not available
	Took the points I found from overlaying the 1988 F&S Azz plot into a spreadsheet and applied a 6th-order fit
	Added the 1988 F&S fit to a new subscript to get b1 in the QE range
	Debugged code to accurately pull in the F&S fit
	Added progress to b1 in QE to the b1 wiki
	Editted b1 rates code to include a grey curve of the F&S plot on Azz
	Debugging QE b1 rates code
	Scanned over Q2 for HMS b1 point in QE
	Wrote bash script to automatically loop over Q2 values
	Scanned over Q2 for HMS and SHMS to check QE b1 rates
	Edited script so that it scans over each of the four x bins on its own
	Edited script to allow for 5 bins in x
	Edited plotting script to show all 5 bins in x for both the HMS and the SHMS
	Recorded progress on b1 wiki
	Scanned over both Q2 and incoming beam energy ranges with b1 rates code
	Added results to b1 wiki
	Getting kinematics for Azz in 0.75<x<1.8 region
	Added results to b1 wiki
	Checked that I already checked the cross section results against data
	Fixed the uncertainties to reflect the large asymmetry
	Estimated rates for a one-week-long Azz experiment
	Worked on Azz rates code and summary
	Azz Meeting
	Fixed rates estimate (they were about 10% too high)
	Cleaned up Azz rates code (removed ~1/3 of lines, all unnecessary)
	Scanned over W
	Uploaded results to b1 wiki
	Added systematic uncertainty band to Azz plot
	Split Azz into 1.25*Azz and 0.75*Azz
	Send Q2 and new Azz plots to Patricia and Karl to catch the eye of theorists
	Played with Azz rates to get the SHMS below the prescale cut-off
	Looked at how x>0.75 uncertainties compare with x<0.75 ones
	Wrote up comparison between Azz for x>0.75 and x<0.75
	Made pretty versions of Azz plots for Karl's tenure tak
	Combined b1 DIS, QE, and Azz plots into a single, large x-range Azz and kinematics plots
	Checked cross sections and dilution factor changes vs x -- need to change how this is handled for x>1
	Plotted dilution factor vs. x for the SHMS
	Wrote script to look at the cross sections and dilution factor with a higher resolution in x
	Fixed the hard-coded dilution factor in ptrates.f
	Studied the changes in the dilution factor over x
	Wrote up a summary of this morning's study on the b1 wiki
	Changed cross sections to include F1 and F2 from Bosted
	Wrote up summary of effects on b1 wiki


Quasi-Elastic 3He
	Fixed GlobusConnect connection
	Submitted Q2=0.1 Ay0 jobs to the farm (turns out I analyzed them as neutrons-only instead of no-vetos)
	Ay0 submissions failed -- looked into why
	Fixed bug where Ay0 was crashing when defining event type
	Submitted new batch of Ay0 analysis to the farm
	Looked into why Ay0 jobs continued to fail
	Became really confused as to why Ay0 jobs are failing
	Changed ~/.cshrc variables back to linux64 (instead of CentOS 6.2) and re-instally ROOT and the analyzer to try and get Ay0 running


Papers and Grants


Conference Planning


SysAdmin


Job Issues
	Organized monthly summaries by number of items per project per month and plotted them
	Wrote script to analyze the amount of time I've spent on different projects
	Summarized time results from the plots I made yesterday for Karl
	Audiologist appt and followed up with Disability Services
	Added tag to find when I'm in me*etings to the time analysis code
	Updated time analysis to weight mee*tings by 1 hour and the rest divided equally between 8 hours - # mee*tings
	Changed JLab, UNH, and UNH Physics passwords
	Caught up on old e-mails
	Installed calendar in the lab
	Attended Karl's tenure colloqiuum (meeting)


Other
	oSTEM interest group meeting
	Lost keys and went hunting for them (Found them!)
	Promoted oSTEM at U-Day
	Promoted oSTEM at LGBTQA Garden Party
	Meeting for the President's Commission on GLBT Issues
	Meeting with high-school students and showed them around the lab
