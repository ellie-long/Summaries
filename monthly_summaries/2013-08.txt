UNH Lab
	Local g2p meeting
	Local g2p meeting
	UNH Collaboration Meeting
	Began soldering 19-pin connector for the AMI magnet electronics
	Continuing soldering electronics for AMI magnet
	Finished soldering electronics for AMI magnet
	Switched out top vacuum chamber on the big pumps to a 90-degree angle piece
	Moved turbopump down to the lab
	Hooked up turbopump and began pumping down the cryostat vacuum jacket
	Continuing to pump down the cryostat vacuum chamber
	Worked on designing a system to include temperature sensors in the cryostat
	Priced soldering iron and fuses for the lab
	Tried to figure out how to create a better vacuum on the cryostat jacket
	Rearranged the vacuum tubing to attempt to get a better vacuum
	Fixed the vacuum tubing! Turns out the gauge had the wrong zero-setting. Set to factory conditions and we seem good to go!
	Scheduled pick-up of the cryostat lift
	Opened ballast on the DUO pump and ran the pumps for ~30 minutes -- everything is running great
	Organized new equipment in the lab
	Did dry run-through of magnet cool down
	Played with roots pump vacuum gauge to see if I could fix it -- no luck :-(
	Set up pegboard in the lab
	Rearranged lab to prepare for cooldown
	Attempted to connect the electronics rack to the PC
	Attempted to get any piece on the rack to talk to the PC via GPIB
	Recorded yesterday's temp/humidity data
	Put together monthly activity summary
	Recorded yesterday's temp/humidity data

Quasi-Elastic 3He
	Replayed Q2=0.1 Ay0 data
	Running Q2=0.5 Ay0 data
	Replayed Q2=1.0 Ay0 data
	Found that *.root files were coming out large due to an old problem with outputting too many histograms -- This was fixed (the same way as in https://userweb.jlab.org/~ellie/QEA-meetings/2010-03-10.html )
	Worked on running the charge/lt locally
	Wrote code so that the charge/livetime information can be analyzed in parallel on my local machine
	Wrote script to automatically merge necessary files to get asymmetries
	Finalizing Ay0 Q2=0.1 results
	Confirmed that the charge/lt Q2=0.1 Ay0 runs from last night ran successfully 
	Updated plots of Ay0 and Ay for Q2=0.1
	Prepared Quasi-Elastic website for next week's meeting
	Plotted new Q2=0.5 Ay0 plots
	Plotted new Q2=1.0 Ay0 plots
	Made final Ay0 plots
	Finished up Ay0 analysis for Friday's meeting
	Quasi-Elastic Meeting
	Finalized Ay0 data, including adding prescale uncertainties to the Q2=0.1 point
	Worked on making pretty the final Ay0 plots, but found they were quite a bit different from previous results
	Looked into why the Ay0 plots were different
	Worked on code that will let me reanalyze some Ay0 data to double-check with older data
	Set up an analysis account so that I can run QE analysis without having hundreds of windows popping up on me drawing histograms
	Tested QE analysis account to make sure that it's working correctly
	Running analysis locally is taking forever (one run is still going from last night)
	Re-setup globusconnect because it was having problems
	Sent Q2=0.1 Ay0 files to JLab for farm analysis
	Submitted Ay0 Q2=0.1 jobs to the farm
	Ay0 farm anaylsis is still failing -- looked into figuring out why
	Made pretty Ay0 vs. Q2 plots for Simon
