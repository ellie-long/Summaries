	Local g2p meeting
	Local g2p Meeting
	Cleaned up the rack in the lab
	Figured out what it would take to lift the magnet internals out of the dewar
	Secured GPIB cabling in the electronics rack
	Signed up for manual support at mymercurysupport.com to find out what type of ILM LN2 level probe we need (there are multiple types without descriptions of their differences)
	Attempted to figure out what type of LN2 and LHe level probes we need -- in progress
	Continued looking into pricing of hoists and I-beams
	Called Oxford Instruments and found out what we need for N2/He probes
	Measured the diameter of the holes in the AMI magnet to make sure that a N2 probe will fit into it
	Continued putting together list of items needed for a summer cool-down of the AMI magnet
	Organized cryogen transfer lines onto a rack
	Looking into where the LN2 and LHe probes are/if we have them
	Finalized list of items needed for magnet cooldown -- need to look into specific measurements for a few items yet
	Put together generalized list of items needed to cool down the AMI magnet this summer
	Called AMI and got specifics on fringe magnet fields, types of connectors and cables needed
	Found out what type of fittings we need to connect the LN2 transfer line to the blow-out tube (from 3/8" NPT to 3/8" ID surgical tubing)
	Called hoist company about possibility of a cross-beam: Really expensive and probably not worth it
	Finalized list of items needed for summer AMI magnet cool-down
	Finished pricing equipment needed for the summer cool-down
	Checked that the Minuteman turbo pump we have access to will suit AMI's vacuum jacket needs
	Contacted Seth at AMI to confirm that the pressure gauge we have access to will working
	Finished pricing/ordering list for cool down items
	Began pricing of cool down equipment list
	Set up camera to record temp/humidity in the lab every 6 hours (In the future, might want to look into Amazon Mechanical Turk to analysis data from pictures)
	Met with safety services who walked through the lab
	Moved packing items to the attic
	Cleaned up lab floorspace
	Made spreadsheet for lab temp/humidity

	Set up git for the b1 proposal at https://github.com/ellie-long/b1_documents.git
	Began looking through the rates information from Patricia
	b1 Meeting
	Inquired about structure of b1_rates folder from Patricia
	Skype call with Patricia to go over how the rates code works
	Attempting to translate fortran code to C++ so that I can read it easily
	Played with b1_rates 
	Played with b1 rates code -- succesfully translated qvec.f to qvec.cpp
	Attempted to install GEMC to play with SoLID in GEANT4 -- failed


Azz
