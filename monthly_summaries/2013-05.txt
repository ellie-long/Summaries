UNH Lab
	Local g2p meeting
	Found the magnet's central location in the lab
	Marked off 5-Gauss line around the magnet central location
	Trying to find a smaller pallet lift for the new magnet
	Rearranged lab to open up a wide space in the center of the room
	Showed the lab to the magnet safety people
	Magent Safety Training
	Found out that we can't move the new magnet in the lab because it's on too small of a palette


b1
	Worked on b1 rates with Azz containing a plus- and minus- tensor polarized target
	b1 meeting
	Added A_meas^(2) method to the b1 code
	I've also been neglecting it in my daily reports, but I've spent a lot of time working on the A_zz formalism on the b1 wiki ( https://hallcweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/User:Ellie )
	Put the total kinematic spread into the b1 rates code
	Working on making the b1 kinematics plots acceptable for the proposal
	Information on how I spent the weekend can be found here: https://hallcweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/User:Ellie
	My rates and Patricia's differ by a factor of 4 -- trying to isolate it
	Rates code fixed, it now matches Patricia's
	Working on re-scanning over Q2 now that I have more accurate plots
	Re-scanning over x bins
	Played with cuts to improve Azz errors
	Spent the evening (and the next two days) working on finalizing rates and working on the b1 proposal
	Worked on finalizing rates
	Worked on b1 proposal
	Worked pretty much constantly on b1 proposal
	Approaching midnight, the b1 proposal was submitted
	Worked on finalizing rates
	Worked on b1 proposal
	Worked pretty much constantly on b1 proposal
	Before midnight, b1 proposal was submitted
	Going over b1 rates code once more before archiving them on-line for the future
	Archived rates code at UNH website and linked to it from the b1 wiki
	Fixed Azz systematic error bars
	Double-checked the 9.2% systematic error bars -- they seem to be working fine
	b1 meeting
	Figured out flight information for PAC, still need to book
	Reserved flight/car for PAC meeting
	Looking into luminosity monitor
	b1 meeting
	Started writing up short paper on the extra asymmetries
	Added systematic uncertainty bands on Azz and b1 estimates
	Researched into luminosity monitor
	Fixed full error bars on b1 wiki
	b1 meeting
	Worked on optimizing systematic uncertainty with Oscar
	Changed how the b1 rates code works so that it output the number of events for each setting that fall in each x bin
	Found and debugged some errors in the b1 rates code


Azz


Quasi-Elastic 3He
	Wrote a python script to extract charge and LT information from Yawei's *.log files
	Comparing my information to Yawei's
	Nailed the problem causing a difference between my results and Yawei's -- the charge
	Checked charge script for bugs -- moving the initial counter to first event instead of second to see if that helps
	Prepared Quasi-Elastic website
	Quasi-elastic meeting
	Met with Yawei to diagnose issue with charge (happened to also find small issue with LT)
	Still working on reinstalling ROOT...
	Put together Quasi-Elastic website
	Worked on reinstalling the analyzer
	Quasi-Elastic Meeting
	Put together plots for the Hall A Collaboration meeting
	Continued trying to install Hall A Analyzer
	Working on figuring out what's wrong with the ROOT/analyzer installation
	Continued trying to debug ROOT/analyzer problem


Papers and Grants
	Worked on Tech Note for b1 rates calculations
	Worked on rates tech note
	Worked on b1 rates tech note
	Worked on tech note on extra asymmetries that come into play in b1
	Making edits to both b1 tech notes
	Edited b1 tech notes to include systematic uncertainty bands
	Added error table to b1 Rates tech note


Conference Planning


SysAdmin


Job Issues
	Put together monthly summary
	Fixed buzzing computer fan
	Working on reinstalling ROOT, since I apparently messed it up at some point
	Working on fixing ROOT because, like an idiot, I screwed it up :-(
	Tried out new captioning service (Caption Colorado) for the EG4 meeting 
	Finally (!!!) go ROOT working again!! :-D :-D :-D 
	Put instructions of how I fixed ROOT into the ELog
	...now the analyzer isn't working. :-(
	Meeting with Disability Services
