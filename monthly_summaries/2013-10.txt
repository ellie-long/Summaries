	Designed mount for temperature sensors
	Talked with Sarah about locating vendors and machining parts for the AMI temp. sensor mounts
	Maintenaince running of the roots pumps
	Dry run-through of AMI cool-down to put together a list of yet-needed parts
	Finalized design for temp sensor mount
	Began pricing final equipment needed before cool-down
	Made measurements of top of cryostat to mount a vacuum plate onto
	Finished list (minus regulators and Cernox mounts) of items needed and sent to Karl
	Organized incoming equipment into the lab
	Met with Karl to discuss final touches before cool-down, possible NSF MRI proposal, and future work
	Put together new Magnet To-Do list
	Talked with AirGas about coming in to look at our set-up
	Maintence run of the roots pump
	Set date for cryostat installation
	Contacted Ideal Vacuum Products to find a top plate for the cryostat that we could machine to fit


b1
	Studied b1 cross sections using F1 only simplified cs and F1 & F2 full cs
	Updated b1 wiki with results
	Compared cross sections to data
	Uploaded cross section comparisons to b1 wiki
	Began, but didn't finish, redoing estimates for b1 using the updated rates code
	Repeated the same for b1
	Put plots on the b1 wiki
	Plotted b1 one last time without extra lines in the systematic uncertainties


Azz
	Added QE and IE parts of F1 and F2 into the cross section calculations
	Plotted cross sections with full (DIS+QE) Bosted functions
	Compared Misak and Bosted code to data
	Wrote up comparisons on b1 wiki
	Spilt up QE and DIS parts of the Bosted cross sections to see contributions from each
	Added dilution factor inputs into ptrates code
	Re-optimized Azz plots with better cross-section calculations
	Attempted to compare dilution factor between SHMS/HMS, but didn't finish
	Added cross-section and dilution factor calculations to b1 wiki summary of Azz re-optimization
	Put up final Bosted rates estimates for Azz
	Updated Azz 1 week plot to show statisics coming from each individual spectrometer
	Updated Azz 2 week plot to show statisics coming from each individual spectrometer
	Made new filies for Azz plots
	Added dilution factor in place of b1 on Azz plots
	Color-coded Azz kinematics plots by cross-section
	Played with Q2 and bin size for Azz
	Meeting with Karl to update him on progress made while he was in Germany at Mainz
