b1
	Working on the b1 cross sections to add LiD and (He+D)D
	Attempted to find the densities of LiD and ND3 -- failed (but did find NH3 and LiH)
	Played around with the b1 rates code to check the cross section between LiD and (HeD)D
	Added lumi*sig calculations to ptrates code to see where the difference in rates b/t LiD & He2D are coming from
	Continued looking into rates difference between LiD & He2D
	Fixed LiD/He2D rates in b1 code & wrote up conclusions with all things being the same
	Looked into D and N cross sections again


Azz
	Worked on Azz talk for Tensor Workshop
	Send Azz talk first draft around for comments
	Discussed Azz talk with Patricia and Karl
	Worked on Azz talk
	Worked on Azz talk
	Redid Azz cross section-check calculations
	Finished Azz talk
	Began looking into how Misak's code works
	Continued digging into Misak's code
	(5 hr) Worked on adapting Misak's code into the Azz code
	Continued working on implementing Misak's code into the Azz rates
	Phone meeting with Doug on Azz
	Wrote up summary of work in Azz wiki
	Trying to figure out parallel processing in FORTRAN
	Running Q^2 scan using Misak's code
	Began implementing parallel processing into ptrates
	Worked on parallelization of ptrates again
	Found that parallelization of Bosted & Sargsian codes is untenable for the gains received -- abandoning project
	Ran Sargsian code for ND3 Azz


Quasi-Elastic 3He
	Began transferring Ay0 analysis files to UNH to finish analyzing
	Copied Ay0 runs from JLab to UNH
	Began looking into Ay0 analysis, which isn't working like it used to
