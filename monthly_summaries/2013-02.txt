UNH Lab
	UNH Meeting for g2p
	Local Meeting for g2p
	Local g2p meeting
	Re-arranged workspace in lab into a user-friendly configuration
	Set up computer accounts in lab
	Made sure lab is ready for a phone-call meeting space
	Figured out what progress has previously been made with the UVA magnet so that I can take over getting it here
	Figured out sizes needed to transport UVA magnet
	Measured lab space where UVA magnet is going to end up so that it fits
	Finished measuring maximum size that the target has to fit through (1.30m x 2.39 m x 1.943 m)
	Cleaned up computer accounts on the Mac Minis in the lab
	Working on getting rid of mineral oil -- should hear back from facilities tomorrow
	Finished cleaning up computer accounts on the Mac Minis in the lab
	Heard back from facilities -- they won't take the mineral oil in the lab
	Following up with UNH Hazardous Waste Management
	Found out the magnet we thought was going to arrive second (and in April) is arriving later this week
	Figured out how to choreograph the palette mover so that the magnet can get into the lab
	Inquired about how to remove surplus equipment from the lab
	Found out that we need to move the milling machine and the mass spectrometer out of the lab, preferably today
	Came up with a plan to move them so that the magnet will still be able to fit through the hall
	Moved the milling machine and the mass spectrometer into the hallway
	Filled out surplus form for the spectrometer -- for future notice, our department is Physics and the BSC is CEPS (College of Engineering and Physical Sciences)
	Magnet arrived and was put in lab
	Magnet was secured in place
	Inquired facilities about lifting the magnet to get the padding out from under it -- Will need to call them back Monday morning (2-1437)
	Called Facilities to move the magnet -- they're working on figuring out who's in charge of the crank hoist and will get back to me later to scheduling the pick up
	Got the padding out from underneath the magnet
	Rearranged the lab to give us a bit more space
	Made sure that all items that are on the magnet packing slip actually arrived (There are three items I want Karl to double-check)
	Read AMI magnet manual
	Cleaned up workspace in the lab
	Installed Oxford Intsruments cards into the Mercury tCI box
	Scanned AMI Magnet manual into PDFs
	Began testing the Oxford Instruments cards
	Created *.pdf file of the AMI Magnet manual


b1
	Attended Patricia Solvignon's technical talk
	Attended Patricia Solvignon's Colloqium
	Read P. Hoodbhoy et al., Nucl. Phys. B312, 571 (1989)
	Got in touch with Hazardous Waste Manangement -- They are going to pick up the oil later today
	Read A. Airapetian, et al., PRL 95, 242001 (2005)
	Read LOI for b1 at PAC 37
	Meeting for b1

Quasi-Elastic 3He
	Quasi-Elastic Meeting
	Squashed bug in QE charge analysis code
	Code used to get charge per 3He target state from ungated u3c
	Checked out results of QE bug-squashing
	Worked on QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 data in a final attempt to local the discrepencies
	Backed-up JLab website locally to make uploads for it easier in the future
	Played with error estimate for QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 point, trying to find the best way to present the data
	Checked out different groupings of QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 data to try and get the best error bars
	Played around some more with the QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 data to figure out how to best handle the uncertainty
	QE weekly meeting
	More work on QE Q2=0.5 point
	Made plot of Ay0 vs nu for Q2=0.1
	Remade all Ay0 vs nu plots
	Worked on Ay0 paper
	Put together QE website for meeting
	Worked on Ay0 run-by-run systematic uncertainties for Q2=0.1 and 1.0
	Attempted (and failed) to try and figure out a way that I can process Ay0 *.root files from off-site
	Worked a bit on trying to compile ROOT *.C files using g++ so that I can run them using GNU parallel
	Tried to change how QE analysis script runs so that I can run it from the UNH desktop
	Attempted to reinstall ROOT using gcc 4.6 so that I can use parallel threading (#pragma, openMP) -- Failed
	Left ROOT compiling last night -- no go, it still is freezing at libPyRoot.o
	Got updated charge and livetime information from Q2=0.1 Ay0 data
	In process of getting updated charge and livetime information from Q2=1.0 Ay0 data
	Still attempting to recompile ROOT, still failing. It works fine with gcc 3.4, but I need it to work with 4.6 so that I can use parallel threading. :-P
	Updated QE website for meeting
	Quasi-Elastic meeting
	Met with Yawei to help him use InkScape
	Edited Ay0 vs nu plots in Ay0 paper
