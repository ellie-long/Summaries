	b1 Meeting
	Set up git for the b1 proposal at https://github.com/ellie-long/b1_documents.git
	Began looking through the rates information from Patricia
	b1 Meeting
	Inquired about structure of b1_rates folder from Patricia
	Skype call with Patricia to go over how the rates code works
	Attempting to translate fortran code to C++ so that I can read it easily
	Played with b1_rates 
	Played with b1 rates code -- succesfully translated qvec.f to qvec.cpp
	Attempted to install GEMC to play with SoLID in GEANT4 -- failed
	Working on the b1 cross sections to add LiD and (He+D)D
	Attempted to find the densities of LiD and ND3 -- failed (but did find NH3 and LiH)
	Played around with the b1 rates code to check the cross section between LiD and (HeD)D
	Added lumi*sig calculations to ptrates code to see where the difference in rates b/t LiD & He2D are coming from
	Continued looking into rates difference between LiD & He2D
	Fixed LiD/He2D rates in b1 code & wrote up conclusions with all things being the same
	Looked into D and N cross sections again
