g2p
UNH Collaboration Meeting
g2p Meeting


EG4
Reached out to Marco to figure out how to test that gpp and RECSIS are working correctly
EG4 Meeting


b1
Confirmed that magnet only has a few wires attached to the backside of the 19-pin cable (We'll need to add extra for the thermometry)
Added systematic uncertainty band to Azz plot
Split Azz into 1.25*Azz and 0.75*Azz
Send Q2 and new Azz plots to Patricia and Karl to catch the eye of theorists
Roots pump maintenaince run
Played with Azz rates to get the SHMS below the prescale cut-off
Looked at how x>0.75 uncertainties compare with x<0.75 ones
Wrote up comparison between Azz for x>0.75 and x<0.75
Made pretty versions of Azz plots for Karl's tenure tak
Combined b1 DIS, QE, and Azz plots into a single, large x-range Azz and kinematics plots
Checked cross sections and dilution factor changes vs x -- need to change how this is handled for x>1
Plotted dilution factor vs. x for the SHMS


Quasi-Elastic
Fixed GlobusConnect connection
Submitted Q2=0.1 Ay0 jobs to the farm (turns out I analyzed them as neutrons-only instead of no-vetos)
Ay0 submissions failed -- looked into why
Fixed bug where Ay0 was crashing when defining event type
Submitted new batch of Ay0 analysis to the farm
Looked into why Ay0 jobs continued to fail
Became really confused as to why Ay0 jobs are failing
Changed ~/.cshrc variables back to linux64 (instead of CentOS 6.2) and re-instally ROOT and the analyzer to try and get Ay0 running


Job Issues
Installed calendar in the lab
Attended Karl's tenure colloqiuum (meeting)


Other
Meeting with high-school students and showed them around the lab
