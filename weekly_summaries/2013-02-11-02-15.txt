Structure Physics
	UNH Meeting for g2p
	Figured out what progress has previously been made with the UVA magnet so that I can take over getting it here
	Figured out sizes needed to transport UVA magnet
	Measured lab space where UVA magnet is going to end up so that it fits
	Finished measuring maximum size that the target has to fit through (1.30m x 2.39 m x 1.943 m)
	Cleaned up computer accounts on the Mac Minis in the lab
	Working on getting rid of mineral oil -- should hear back from facilities tomorrow
	Finished cleaning up computer accounts on the Mac Minis in the lab
	Heard back from facilities -- they won't take the mineral oil in the lab
	Following up with UNH Hazardous Waste Management
	Read P. Hoodbhoy et al., Nucl. Phys. B312, 571 (1989)

Quasi-Elastic
	Checked out results of QE bug-squashing
	Worked on QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 data in a final attempt to local the discrepencies
	Backed-up JLab website locally to make uploads for it easier in the future
	Played with error estimate for QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 point, trying to find the best way to present the data
	Checked out different groupings of QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 data to try and get the best error bars
	Played around some more with the QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 data to figure out how to best handle the uncertainty
	QE weekly meeting
	More work on QE Q2=0.5 point

New Job Issues
	Figured out UNH time sheets
	Set up UNH webpage (http://nuclear.unh.edu/~elong)
	Set up ssh proxy so that I can access Science Direct papers using the JLab server
