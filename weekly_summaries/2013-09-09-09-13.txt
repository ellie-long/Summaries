b1
Checked current b1 code to see where it is in regards to calculating the QE region (F1 and F2 are ready, just need a model that extends Azz to higher x)
Raised lift stand to its maximum height to prepare for first lift tomorrow
Ran roots pump for 30 minute maintenaince run
Prepped lab for tomorrow's lift
Played with b1 rates code to stake a claim on the x>1 measurement
Completed first magnet lift
Got measurements on the bottom plate for future thermometry stand
Measured the inner diameter in the top and bottom of the cryostat
Figured out how to move the cryostat
Found out we'll need to solder more wires to include the thermometry
Worked on incorporating the 1988 Frankfurt and Strikman Azz plot into the b1 rates code for x>1
Estimated the 1988 F&S Azz plot using a spreadsheet and image overlay, as unfortunately a direct calculation is not available
Took the points I found from overlaying the 1988 F&S Azz plot into a spreadsheet and applied a 6th-order fit
Added the 1988 F&S fit to a new subscript to get b1 in the QE range
Debugged code to accurately pull in the F&S fit
Added progress to b1 in QE to the b1 wiki
Editted b1 rates code to include a grey curve of the F&S plot on Azz
Lifted magnet internals out to show to Karl and to continue planning placement of thermometry 
Debugging QE b1 rates code
Scanned over Q2 for HMS b1 point in QE
Wrote bash script to automatically loop over Q2 values
Scanned over Q2 for HMS and SHMS to check QE b1 rates
Edited script so that it scans over each of the four x bins on its own
Edited script to allow for 5 bins in x
Edited plotting script to show all 5 bins in x for both the HMS and the SHMS
Recorded progress on b1 wiki


Quasi-Elastic


Job Issues
Audiologist appt and followed up with Disability Services
Added tag to find when I'm in me*etings to the time analysis code
Updated time analysis to weight mee*tings by 1 hour and the rest divided equally between 8 hours - # mee*tings
