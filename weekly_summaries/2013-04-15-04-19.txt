b1
Working on adding QE peak to b1 rates code
Got the b1 rates code to accept x values up to x=0.9
Got quasi-elastic peak kind of working in b1 code (can get up to x=0.98)
Added dx error bars in b1 rates code
Trying to double-check that the cross section part of the code is working correctly -- I think there's a problem
Made sure the cross section calculations in the b1 rates code works correctly
Making a copy of the rates script in a spreadsheet so that I understand absolute everything that it's doing
Made website for b1 meeting
b1 Meeting
Completely understand what the b1 rates code is doing (Finally!! :-D )
Matched up back-of-envelope calculation of rates to the b1 rates code -- they are within the same order of magnitude! :-D (Off by about 0.6, but that could be due to kinematic clipping that the b1 rates code does that the quick estimate doesn't take into account)
Playing with b1 rates spreadsheet
Updated labbook with the work I've been doing
Began implementing He and N cross sections into spreadsheet
Working on figuring out how dAzz is calculated from the rates


Quasi-Elastic
Continued comparison between Yawei's and my Ay0 data to try and find errors (LT is off the most)
Put together website for Quasi-Elastic meeting
