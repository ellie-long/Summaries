Quasi-Elastic
Replayed Q2=1.0 Ay0 data
Found that *.root files were coming out large due to an old problem with outputting too many histograms -- This was fixed (the same way as in https://userweb.jlab.org/~ellie/QEA-meetings/2010-03-10.html )
Worked on running the charge/lt locally
Wrote code so that the charge/livetime information can be analyzed in parallel on my local machine
Wrote script to automatically merge necessary files to get asymmetries
Finalizing Ay0 Q2=0.1 results
Confirmed that the charge/lt Q2=0.1 Ay0 runs from last night ran successfully
