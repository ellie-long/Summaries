Weekly Summary

EG4/g2p


b1
Worked on rates for b1 -- found a problem with the cross sections and dilution factors
b1 meeting
Working on the b1 cross sections so that they give a ratio of ~0.3 instead of ~0.0085
Finalized rates calculations, things look good!
Writing up what I did for the b1 meeting tomorrow
Worked on b1 rates with Azz containing a plus- and minus- tensor polarized target
b1 meeting
Added A_meas^(2) method to the b1 code
I've also been neglecting it in my daily reports, but I've spent a lot of time working on the A_zz formalism on the b1 wiki ( https://hallcweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/User:Ellie )
Put the total kinematic spread into the b1 rates code
Working on making the b1 kinematics plots acceptable for the proposal
My rates and Patricia's differ by a factor of 4 -- trying to isolate it
Rates code fixed, it now matches Patricia's
Working on re-scanning over Q2 now that I have more accurate plots
Re-scanning over x bins
Played with cuts to improve Azz errors
Spent the evening (and the next two days) working on finalizing rates and working on the b1 proposal
