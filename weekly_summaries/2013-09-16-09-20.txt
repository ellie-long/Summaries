g2p Meeting


b1
Local b1 meeting
Worked on b1 rates code to continue allowing for quasi-elastic and SRC-range physics
Added more x bins (up to 11) to b1 rates code
Edited b1 rates code to properly plot the kinematics when only a single spectrometer is being looked at
Scanned over both Q2 and incoming beam energy ranges with b1 rates code
Added results to b1 wiki
Routine mainetaince run on the roots pump
Getting kinematics for Azz in 0.75<x<1.8 region
Added results to b1 wiki
Checked that I already checked the cross section results against data
Fixed the uncertainties to reflect the large asymmetry
Estimated rates for a one-week-long Azz experiment
Worked on Azz rates code and summary
Azz Meeting
Fixed rates estimate (they were about 10% too high)
Cleaned up Azz rates code (removed ~1/3 of lines, all unnecessary)
Scanned over W
Uploaded results to b1 wiki


Quasi-Elastic


Job Issues
