Azz
Reading up on 2H(e,e'p) scattering
Attempting to define X(e,e'p) scattering cross sections to add to Azz code
Installed GEANT4 locally
Reading up on pmin relation to try and include X(e,e'p)
Continuing to look into adding (e,e'p) cross section to Azz calculations
Continued looking into (e,e'p)
Continued looking into (e,e'p) measurement
Picked up book from the library on (e,e'p) scattering and read through it


Quasi-Elastic 3He
Checked on ifarm Ay0 replays -- only took two hours to run! (I should have start this 5 years ago...)
Fixed neutron hunt Ay0 analysis code and submitted Q2=0.1 data to the farm
Checked last night's Ay0 analysis runs -- having troubles
Continued troubleshooting Ay0 analysis problems
Got Ay0 analysis running on the farm
Submitted Q2=0.1 to the farm
Noticed ifarm Ay0 runs weren't going to finish, so re-submitting them in smaller chunks
Looked into why Ay0 runs were failing, and re-submitted them slightly fixed


Conference Planning
Updated Joanna on the poster revision
Touched base with speakers for Tensor Workshop
Meeting with Karl to discuss Tensor Workshop & X(e,e'p) calculations
Got second draft of Tensor Workshop poster and sent new comments back
Tensor Workshop Meeting
Got flights & bus for the Tensor Workshop


Job Issues

Read through and commented on new BPG
TPACC meeting
