b1
Added He-4 and N-14 rates to spreadsheet
Added Mott and unpolarized cross sections for He-3 and N-14 into the b1 rates FORTRAN script -- haven't included in the total yet
Changed the b1 rates FORTRAN script so that it uses absolute error bars instead of relative ones
Added He-4 and N-14 rates into the b1 rates code
Finalized x=0.1 to x=1.0 rates at total rate=1kHz and 50kHz
Added Oscar's corrections to the b1 rates note document
Included total rates in the output of the b1 rates code
Fixed the time calculation (it was in days, I switched it to hours)
Began playing the rates game in two parts: 1) with total rate < 1kHz, 2) with total rate < 50kHz
Ran rates code for 50kHz and 500 kHz total rates
b1 Meeting
Added spectrometer theta and E' limits to b1 rates code
Began working on switching the meaning of prec in b1 rates code -- currently, it's dAzz, but I want to make it time so that the code will be easier to run
Mapped out F1 for each of the x points we're looking at
Minimized db1 in rates plot
Wrote script to scan F1 over a large x range, within kinematics we can take
