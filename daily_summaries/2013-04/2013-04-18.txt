Made sure the cross section calculations in the b1 rates code works correctly
Making a copy of the rates script in a spreadsheet so that I understand absolute everything that it's doing
Made website for b1 meeting
b1 Meeting
Completely understand what the b1 rates code is doing (Finally!! :-D )
Matched up back-of-envelope calculation of rates to the b1 rates code -- they are within the same order of magnitude! :-D (Off by about 0.6, but that could be due to kinematic clipping that the b1 rates code does that the quick estimate doesn't take into account)
