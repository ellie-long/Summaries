Got caught up with Daily & Weekly summaries
Put together a list of items that need to be done in the lab, and figured out the next projects for everyone to work on
Okra stopped working, so I set up each of the Macs downstairs as individual client machines without a shared server directory
Edited how vetos are handled in HAND analysis so that it is done by layer instead of by groups of bars
