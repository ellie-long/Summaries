Answered Dustin's questions on our observable
EG4 Meeting
Hand-calculated the difference between rel & nonrel, since I can't make the theta=0 & 180 parts asymmetric
Figured out correct definition of Azz in terms of F&S's ratios
Meeting with Donal to try and figure out why Azz isn't asymmetric with theta
Started working on creating a different R(k) that's unique from R(p)
Meeting with Simonetta, who is excited for Azz!
Put together example plots and tables of wavefunction for Simonetta
