Daily Summary

Found out that we need to move the milling machine and the mass spectrometer out of the lab, preferably today
Came up with a plan to move them so that the magnet will still be able to fit through the hall
Got the wireless network working in the lab
Moved the milling machine and the mass spectrometer into the hallway
Filled out surplus form for the spectrometer -- for future notice, our department is Physics and the BSC is CEPS (College of Engineering and Physical Sciences)
Figured out how git works and used it to version control my batch/inputs/neutron_hunt files
Attempted (and failed) to try and figure out a way that I can process Ay0 *.root files from off-site
