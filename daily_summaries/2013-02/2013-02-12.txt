Backed-up JLab website locally to make uploads for it easier in the future
Figured out sizes needed to transport UVA magnet
Measured lab space where UVA magnet is going to end up so that it fits
Played with error estimate for QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 point, trying to find the best way to present the data
Checked out different groupings of QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 data to try and get the best error bars
Finished measuring maximum size that the target has to fit through (1.30m x 2.39 m x 1.943 m)
Played around some more with the QE Ay0 Q2=0.5 data to figure out how to best handle the uncertainty
