Still attempting to recompile ROOT, still failing. It works fine with gcc 3.4, but I need it to work with 4.6 so that I can use parallel threading. :-P
Got the padding out from underneath the magnet
Rearranged the lab to give us a bit more space
Made sure that all items that are on the magnet packing slip actually arrived (There are three items I want Karl to double-check)
Read AMI magnet manual
