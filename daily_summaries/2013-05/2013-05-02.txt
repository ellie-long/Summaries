Daily Summary

5/2/2013

Put together monthly summary
Added A_meas^(2) method to the b1 code
I've also been neglecting it in my daily reports, but I've spent a lot of time working on the A_zz formalism on the b1 wiki ( https://hallcweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/User:Ellie )
Put the total kinematic spread into the b1 rates code
Working on making the b1 kinematics plots acceptable for the proposal
